### ‚ú® Info
I am a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4RtvMQp10&list=LL&index=10&t=33s">computer science major</a> at Tufts University and a TA for <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/118/index.html">CS-118 Cloud Computing</a>.

I design simulations, genetic algorithms, and computational models for <a href="https://allencenter.tufts.edu/our-team/michael-levin/">Dr. Michael Levin</a> in the <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/levin/">Levin Lab</a> at Tufts in order to better understand morphogenesis.

### üëæ Selected Projects
#### Public:
- <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJvzNHr3fZX5sgO7CGUvB8EvKvSjwurWbByP06z-erw/edit#heading=h.x2jzluybw5">**Deploy and Collect Workflow-Centric Traces from Microservice Applications**</a>: Collaborated with OperateFirst to deploy microservice applications on the Mass Open Cloud cluster which we used to collect and analyze metrics, traffic, and other telemetry data.  Wrote a guide for researchers to better understand how to deploy and collect traces from microservice applications.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/derekimmuto/ConsentUs">**Consentus**</a>: A blockchain project for simplifying and securing patient consent in clinical trials. Won Highest Usability Award at the MIT Bitcoin Hackathon.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/immuto-inc/Immunify">**Immunify**</a>: A platform empowering citizens to improve the health of their local communities and to support national research in order to combat Covid-19.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/psmiley2/Face-and-Object-Recognizer">**ML/DL classifier**</a>: Takes in data from the webcam and identifies both faces and brightly colored objects on screen in real time. Puts a box around objects where the color of the box matches the object's color.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/psmiley2/9ca55caf10e1aaa24793c9ee2eda8b04">**Neuroimaging Optimal Path Approximation**</a>: A genetic algorithm to provide a customized approximation to the NP Hard traveling salesman problem.  Created for a neuroscientist to find an efficient path for microscope imaging across a section of brain tissue.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/psmiley2/Floodit">**Floodit**</a>: A genetic algorithm built in order to optimally solve the puzzle FloodIt. The board and game was built for Assistive Algorithms. The bot was built for fun.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/psmiley2/Collabratory">**Collabratory**</a>: A classroom tool to take the confusion out of group projects. Made to help both teachers and students. Nominated for the Tufts Ideas Competition.

#### Private (ask me about):
- **Chronicle Notification System**: Designed and implemented Webhook notifications and other full stack improvements to the customer notification system within Chronicle, Google Cloud‚Äôs security product that monitors petabytes worth of telemetry data.
- **Universal Machine**: An emulator for UM code. Can read in an entire file written in UM code (similar to assembly) and compile + execute it using the C programming language.
- **Image Compressor + Decompressor**: An image compressor and decompressor. Comes with a Linux command line tool that allows you to easily import images.
- **Chrome Extension**: A chrome extension and multiple background scripts that allow users to easily leverage blockchain technology such as storing and verifying documents.
- **Permissioning System**: A blockchain based permissioning API that allows users to allow or deny access to the content of documents on the Ethereum blockchain.
